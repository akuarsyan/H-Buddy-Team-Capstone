## EfficientNetV2B0
<p align="left">
  EfficientNetV2B0 is a deep learning model designed for image classification, including ten types of herbal plants. The model has been pre-trained on a very large dataset so that it is able to recognize and extract important features from herbal images.  By training using already labeled images of herbs, the model can provide probability predictions for each plant species when given a new image. EfficientNetV2B0 is very effective in recognizing herbal plant species.

## Dataset
<p align="left">
We collect the dataset ourselves by photographing the herb plants directly in the environment where we live. the data that has been obtained is then augmented using python code by making changes such as image position, image rescale, adding noise to the image, etc.
